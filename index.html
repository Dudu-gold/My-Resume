  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>I am a computer science student at Joseph Ayo Babalola University (JABU). I'm a hardworking and focused individual with a deep passion for technology.</p>
  <p>My journey into computer science began with a simple curiosity: I wanted to understand how websites and applications are built using code. That curiosity grew into a passion, and it led me to make a bold decision. I switched from studying Mathematics at Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) to pursue Computer Science at JABU.</p>
  <p>Since making that switch, i have stayed at the top  of my class. My curiosity has driven me to not only excel academically but also to learn and develop real-world skills in software development.</p>
  <p>Today, i look back on my journey with gratitude, for the growth, the challenges, and the progress i have made.</p>
